# Jenkins Configuration as Code
Jenkins is an open source automation server that development teams use to build, test and deploy their applications. If you have worked in an environment with CI/CD pipelines, chances are that you have used Jenkins. And because Jenkins has so many configuration options and plugins available, it can be quite an effort to set up.

Now imagine configuring all of your infrastructure as code, but configuring the tool that builds, tests and deploys your infrastructure and applications through a web UI. Sounds counterintuitive, right?

## Boilerplate and instructions for configuring Jenkins as Code
